# PeriperalDevices



code to get data from I2C and SPI devices

Code is original writem for MBED  on line compiler 

But to use the code on other platforms it is moved to github 

Now the code is compiled with mbed-cli ( local machine) 

The code of the devices should be ( or will be in ) platfrom independent 

Only the implementation of the I2C interface is platform depending.
